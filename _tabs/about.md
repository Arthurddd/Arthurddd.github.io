I am currently a research assistant in Academia Sinica, where I worked with [Dr. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OL-XGxcAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) in the Music and AI Lab. Before being a research assistant, I studied at National Taiwan University (NTU) and majored in Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE). I finished my bachelor's degree in 2022. 

The research I am interested in is audio generation, neural audio synthesis, audio effect, and intelligent music production.
